These are simple terraform demos to point people to. First off, you need to
install terraform itself -- you can find the installation documentation at
https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html,
but the current version for 64 bit linux is at
https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.8/terraform_0.12.8_linux_amd64.zip
if you just want to cut to the chase. You'll need to unzip the download and then
you should be good to go.

Now you're ready to run you some terraform. Select an example from a directory
in this directory. Each directory has its own readme which will explain what it
does.
